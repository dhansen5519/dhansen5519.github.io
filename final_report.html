                <p>
                    This project served as an introduction to the Unity Game Engine and the fundamentals of game development. 
                    As a beginner project, I chose to create a 2D platformer game featuring tilemaps, sprites, and C# scripting. 
                    The objective was to design a game that included a main menu and progressed through multiple levels as the player advanced. 
                    The main challenges I faced included navigating a brand-new software and understanding the importance of effective version control. 
                    While the final product did not entirely meet my initial expectations, it represented a strong first step in learning game development with Unity.

            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose this project because of my longstanding fascination with video games and my interest in pursuing opportunities in the video game industry. 
                    Many job postings in this field often mention Unity experience as a desirable skill, which motivated me to familiarize myself with the Unity Game Engine. 
                    A 2D platformer game seemed like an ideal starting point for learning Unity due to its simplicity and the opportunity to explore core functionalities like tilemaps, sprites, and scripting.

                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step in the development process was exploring Unityâ€™s documentation and locating supplementary resources to build foundational knowledge. 
                    Setting up my first scene, I turned to external resources such as YouTube tutorials and Zenva's learning materials. 
                    Debugging and scripting challenges often required reliance on Unity Discussion boards, which provided helpful insights into resolving issues.
