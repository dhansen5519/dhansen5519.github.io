                <p>
                    This project served as an introduction to the Unity Game Engine and the fundamentals of game development. As a beginner project, I chose to create a 2D platformer 
                    game featuring tilemaps, sprites, and C# scripting. The objective was to design a game that included a main menu and progressed through multiple levels as the player 
                    advanced. To familiarize myself with Unity, I began by exploring its documentation and other resources to understand the platform's features and capabilities. Once 
                    I gained foundational knowledge, I practiced implementing various functions to build the game. The main challenges I faced included navigating a brand-new software 
                    and understanding the importance of effective version control. While the final product did not entirely meet my initial expectations, it represented a strong first 
                    step in learning game development with Unity.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    I chose this project because of my longstanding fascination with video games and my interest in pursuing opportunities in the video game industry. 
                    Many job postings in this field often mention Unity experience as a desirable skill, which motivated me to familiarize myself with the Unity Game Engine. 
                    My goal was to gain hands-on experience with Unity and understand its fundamental features, providing me with a valuable point of reference for such roles.
                    A 2D platformer game seemed like an ideal starting point for learning Unity due to its simplicity and the opportunity to explore core functionalities like tilemaps,
                    sprites, and scripting. Although I had no prior experience with Unity, my familiarity with programming languages like C and C++ gave me a significant advantage.
                    Since Unity uses C# for scripting, the similarities in syntax between these languages reduced the learning curve for coding tasks. The primary objective of this 
                    project was to develop a functional 2D game that included essential features such as menus, multiple levels, and enemies. This project not only allowed me to delve 
                    into game development but also served as a gateway to understanding the tools and workflows used in the video game industry.

            <section id="project-overview">
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The initial proposal of this project was to develop a 2D platformer game with essential features such as a playable character, multiple levels, a scoring system, and enemies. 
                    The specific goals included:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exploration of Unity's 2D Tools: Gain hands-on experience with tilemaps, sprite handling, and Unity's physics system.</li>
                    <li>Character Movement: Implement character mechanics, including running, jumping, and interacting with platforms.</li>
                    <li>Level Design: Create multiple levels with unique challenges, such as obstacles, moving platforms, and collectibles.</li>
                    <li>Enemy AI: Integrate basic enemy behaviors, such as patrolling and attacking the player.</li>
                    <li>Scoring System: Implement a scoring system to track player progress.</li>
                    <li>Menu System: Develop a functional menu system with options like a main menu, pause menu, and game over screen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I successfully implemented most of these features. The character can move, jump, and interact with various platforms and ground types across the levels. The game includes three 
                    distinct levels featuring obstacles like water hazards and patrolling scorpions. Additionally, a menu system was created, consisting of a main menu, a next level menu, and game over screen.
                    However, some features from the original proposal were not fully implemented. Moving platforms, collectibles, and a scoring system remain as future enhancements. Given more time, I aim to 
                    incorporate these features and expand the game with additional levels, further enhancing the player's experience.

            <section id="learning-process">
                <h2>Learning Process</h2>
                <p>
                    The first step in the development process was exploring Unity’s documentation and locating supplementary resources to build foundational knowledge. While Unity offers comprehensive 
                    documentation, I initially struggled to navigate it effectively. As someone with limited experience learning new software via documentation, this presented a steep learning curve.
                    I mistakenly began with scripting-related material, which was helpful later but not relevant to my starting point. The vast amount of information felt overwhelming, delaying the actual 
                    development process. Eventually, I found documentation that guided me through Unity’s interface, introducing tools like the Inspector and Hierarchy windows, as well as basic features of the physics engine.
                    
                    To set up my first scene, I turned to external resources. A YouTube video walkthrough and tutorials from Zenva were instrumental in helping me create the background, character, and platforms. 
                    These resources also introduced tilemaps, sprite handling, and Unity’s physics system. OpenGameArt.org was invaluable for providing free assets like tilemap artwork and sprite sheets for characters and enemies. 
                    By slicing the sprite sheets in Unity’s Sprite Editor, I created animations for character actions, saving time and avoiding the need to manually design animations.
                    
                    Once the initial level setup was complete, I moved on to scripting for character movement and physics interactions. This phase was challenging, as errors often left me unsure where to begin troubleshooting. The
                    Unity Discussion board became a key resource, allowing me to find relevant threads and use them as a starting point for further exploration in the documentation. Debugging became an essential skill, and I 
                    relied heavily on Unity’s Debug class and log outputs to identify and resolve issues.
                    
                    The implementation of enemy AI was a pivotal learning experience. I learned how to create patrol points that defined the enemy’s movement range and triggers for interactions. For instance, if the player character 
                    collided with the scorpion’s sides, the character’s death animation was triggered. Conversely, landing on the scorpion caused its destruction. Once I successfully implemented this functionality, duplicating the '
                    scorpion object and adjusting its patrol points simplified the process of adding additional enemies.
                    
                    With a functional level in place, I focused on creating additional levels. By duplicating the initial scene, I avoided recreating all settings, colliders, and objects from scratch. This approach allowed me to 
                    focus on unique level designs, such as adding water hazards that triggered character death on contact. Implementing water required creating a trigger zone and adjusting collision logic, reinforcing my 
                    understanding of Unity’s event systems.
                    
                    The menu system was a distinct challenge as it introduced UI components. Incorporating buttons and scripting their functionality required significant trial and error. Linking scenes correctly posed initial 
                    difficulties, but persistence and debugging helped me overcome these obstacles.
                    
                    For testing, I relied on the Debug class, log output, and manual trial-and-error methods. While Unity offers an automated testing framework, I chose not to implement it due to time constraints and the project’s
                    manageable scope. The debug log proved invaluable for monitoring code execution, identifying skipped functions, and narrowing down errors. If I expand this project, I plan to explore Unity’s testing framework to
                    enhance reliability and maintainability.
                    
                    Key challenges included managing colliders and handling animations. Both required extensive trial and error to understand their functionality and impact. The Unity Discussion board was especially helpful in 
                    resolving these issues. Another major challenge involved version control. During an attempt to push my project to GitHub, I inadvertently lost all progress. This setback underscored the importance of maintaining
                    multiple backups, a lesson that significantly shaped my workflow for the remainder of the project. This delay is part of the reason I was unable to complete all the goals I set out for myself.

            <section id="future-improvements">
                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>
                    Some future improvements I would like to implement include moving platforms, collectibles, a scoring system and more levels. The moving platforms would increase the challenge of the levels. Collectibles 
                    like coins would be an add feature to improve score and add another goal to the game. The additional level would allow for more unique levels and challenges. I would also add different kinds of enemies 
                    instead of just the scorpions. I think this would enhance the game and make it more engaging for the user.

                    In terms of improving the existing game, there are some features that could function better and would need some trouble shooting to fix the issue. For example the character animation cycles through the running 
                    animation consistently, even when standing idle. There are animations already created for shoot, melee, slide and others that were not implemented that could add another aspect to the game. The background image 
                    instead of being consistent through the levels is a little uneven and cuts out where you can see a blue line through the image. Lastly, there is an intermittent issue where the scorpion enemies are invisible in 
                    certain playthroughs. Although they still interact with the player, their absence disrupts the visual feedback for the player. Debugging this problem would resolve a critical gameplay inconsistency. Improving 
                    these would make the game feel more polished.

                    Finally, I would add the technical improvement of implementing Unity’s automated testing. It would improve the game’s stability and help ensure that new features do not introduce bugs. Learning and applying this 
                    testing approach would also enhance the project’s scalability for future updates.

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a valuable learning experience that introduced me to the Unity game engine and the fundamentals of 2D game development. Starting with no prior experience in Unity, I was able to build a 
                    functional 2D platformer game complete with character movement, enemies, multiple levels, and a basic menu system. While I encountered several challenges, such as managing colliders, implementing animations, 
                    and debugging code, these obstacles ultimately helped me develop problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of Unity's tools and systems.

                    One of the most significant takeaways from this project was the importance of hands-on practice. Experimenting with Unity's interface, scripting in C#, and troubleshooting issues allowed me to connect 
                    theoretical knowledge with practical application. This process reinforced the value of trial and error, persistence, and leveraging resources like documentation, discussion boards, and tutorials to 
                    overcome learning curves.

                    Reflecting on the project's success, I achieved many of the goals I initially set out for myself, including creating a playable character, designing multiple levels, and implementing a working menu system.
                    Although there are areas for improvement and features yet to be added, the progress I made represents a strong foundation for future projects.

                    Overall, this project has not only introduced me to Unity but also instilled confidence in my ability to learn and adapt to new tools and technologies. It highlighted the significance of iteration and 
                    practice in mastering game development, and I look forward to building on this experience to create more complex and polished projects in the future.
