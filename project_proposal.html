        <h1>Darby Hansen: Developing a 2D Platformer with Unity</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>This project will focus on learning and gaining familiarity with the game development platform, Unity. By building a 2D platformer, I will develop a better understanding of Unity's 2D toolset, C# scripting, physics engine, and level design workflows.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Unity is one of the most widely-used game engines in the industry, and learning how to use it effectively will help prepare me for jobs where it is used. A 2D platformer, with its focus on movement mechanics, physics, and level design, provides an ideal starting point for understanding Unity's capabilities.</p>

            <h2>Specific and Measurable Goals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Gain exposure to Unityâ€™s 2D development tools, such as tilemaps, sprite handling, and the physics system.</li>
                <li>Implement character movement, including running, jumping, and interacting with platforms, using Unity's physics and scripting tools.</li>
                <li>Design and create different levels with different challenges, such as moving platforms, obstacles, and collectibles.</li>
                <li>Integrate basic enemy AI behaviors, such as patrolling and attacking the player.</li>
                <li>Develop a scoring system that tracks player progress.</li>
                <li>Implement a menu system with options like main menu, pause, and game over screens.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learning Curve with Unity:</strong> As Unity is new to me, understanding the more advanced features will take time.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Constraints:</strong> Developing polished levels and mechanics may take longer than expected, given the project timeline.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Mitigation Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Go through tutorials and official Unity documentation to learn the core features step-by-step before starting any coding.</li>
                <li>Focus on completing the essential mechanics and level design first, then polish the game if time permits.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Project Assessments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game contains a few fully functional levels that demonstrate smooth platforming mechanics.</li>
                <li>Character movement, enemy AI, and physics-based interactions work as intended.</li>
                <li>The game features a scoring system and user-friendly UI with menus for level selection, pause, and game over.</li>
                <li>The project is well-documented with a clear code structure and thorough explanations of the design choices.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Completion Criteria</h2>
            <p>The game includes multiple levels with progressively challenging platforming elements. Key mechanics (player movement, AI, physics, scoring, and UI) are fully functional and tested.</p>
