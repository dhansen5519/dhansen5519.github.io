        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>I researched different project ideas for the project proposal.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>Now that the project is decided I am going to create a plan for executing the project and start reading Unity documentation.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>My process was a little unorganized as I was unsure what I wanted to do for a project. Now that I have a waypoint I can begin to get more organized.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Sep 16 - Sep 22</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I started going through the Unity documentation and trying to familiarize my self with some of the different aspects I will be using.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I plan to continue going through documentation and tutorials and create a gameplan for how I want my game to work.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I was able to get more organized over the past week and it helped my prioritize what to work on. I think it will be important going 
          forward to know where my priorities are so that my goals for the project are completed in a timely fashion.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Sep 23 - Sep 29</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I continued going through the Unity documentation.  </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I am continuing to go through some tutorials and documentation. I am also working on setting up my development environment 
          including installing Unity Hub and setting up my Unity account. I am hoping to begin importing the packages and assets I will need if time allows.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>As I am continuing to go through documentation and tutorials, I am finding it very easy to get pulled into different areas that do not apply 
          to my current project, whether it is information outside of the scope of the current project or simply items I will not have time to implement in the current time frame.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>Over the last couple weeks I have just been familiarizing myself with Unity but I am finding it is taking longer than expect because I of the issue mentioned above. As 
          I try to finish up going through documentation I want to try to make sure I am not going through stuff that is not pertinent to what my project is or going through 
          documentation that I will not have time to implement. </p>

        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>Last week was a little unproductive because I was sick so I anticipate this week to be more productive.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Oct 21 - Oct 27</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week was not a great week for me in terms of this project. It was one of those dumb mistakes that I knew better and did it anyways. I had been having 
            issues connecting my project to GitHub over the last few weeks and kept putting it off as I was not sure which files to add to my GitHub.  Where I have a 
            few actual code scripts created I decided it was time to get it all connected. Unfortunately, I was struggling getting my gitignore file to work and allow 
            me to push my files (turned out to be a stupid small error). Somehow during this process I seem to have accidently corrupted my original files. I had a 
            backup saved but it didn't have a lot of my recent progress. It only had some of my original level designs. I have redone some of the work but still have some I have to recreate.  </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week my goal is to get back to where I was before I lost my files. I was about halfway through my character creation and coding. I think I finally have my 
            GitHub linked correctly so hopefully I will not have this issue again. We constantly hear that we need to do this early on but apparently it hasn't really sunk
            in yet. Lesson learned, even if you're not sure what to add to the repository, figure it out and do it early. I'm just thankful it was mostly all my design work 
            and I hadn't completed all my scripting.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>The only potential issue I see is if I continue to have issues with GitHub when I started adding more files.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>It pays to have more than one backup at all times. I am going to make sure all my backups are up to date from now on. </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Weekly Update Oct 28 - Nov 3</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I worked on recreating the stuff that I lost when my project file got deleted. I put a few extra hours in this week and I'm close to being back where I was before. </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I am going to recreate the rest of the work that I lost. I have started reimplementing the character animation for my game and I plan on finishing that and beginning 
            to write the scripts for the character behavior.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>My process last week went a little smoother than I was anticipating. It didn't take as long to recreate stuff as I was not working on a learning curve this time around. It was nice 
            to see that I retained what I learned the first time around in order to be more efficient in my work this time. To me this means the process of learning I was doing was working well 
            and I should maintain that process for the rest of the project. </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Weekly Update Nov 4 - Nov 10</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I worked on the script for my character behavior. I have it at a point that the main character behavior is working properly.  I anticipate making updates to it once I 
            work in AI enemies and whatever bugs pop up with that.  I also created a script for the camera view that makes the camera follow the movement of the player so that it stays within view.  </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I plan on creating the goal point that indicates the end of the level has been achieved.  I also want to start working on implementing the AI enemies.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I'm realizing that some of these processes are a little difficult to prepare for because of all the components involved.  For example, I spent a good chunk of time trying to figure out why my 
            character was falling off the screen instead of staying on the platforms. I'm figuring out how to use the debug log more efficiently which I think will be useful this week.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Nov 11 - Nov 17</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I was preoccupied with exams in a couple classes and was super busy with work so I did not get as much done as I would've liked. I started researching how to implement AI enemies 
            into my game but have not had the opportunity to start work on it. </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I plan to start implementing what I learned last week and try to get fully functioning enemies added to my game. With that, I'm going to work on adjusting the script for my character
            to include how it interacts with the enemies.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>Now that I'm done with my exams I'm looking forward to refocusing my attention to the project.</p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Nov 18 - Nov 24</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I succesfully got the scripting and sprites created for my AI enemies. I also got my player script edited to include destroying enemies. I created the scene and script for the game 
            over menu when the player dies. I started on the scene for the next level menu that pops up when a level is completed. I'm still working on the trigger that indicates the level has been completed.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I want to finish the next level menu and incorporate it to link the different levels I have created together. I also need to go through my levels and incorporate the rest of my enemies now 
            that I have it working on one level. If time permits I am going to start working on the main menu screen. </p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I had a very productive week last week and hope to keep that going this week. </p>

        <h2>Weekly Update Nov 25 - Dec 1</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I enjoyed my Thanksgiving break and took a much need rest so I did not work on my project.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I plan on putting the finishing touches on my project and finalizing my final report.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>A little bit of rest can do a lot of good. Now that I had the chance to recharge a little I'm looking forward to having making a hard push for the finish line and presenting a solid project.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Weekly Update Dec 2 - Dec 8</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I started putting the final touches on my game. I added to my different menus and got the logic working the way I want so the game flows correctly. I had been having issues with my water 
            layer working correctly on my game levels. I was finally able to get it to behave correctly so that my character dies when it hits it. I also made some edits to the quantity and location of my 
            enemies in the levels. Lastly, started work on my final report and making adjustments to my personal website so that the style better suits my project.</p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>I feel like I am close to being able to submit my project. I just need to finish my final report and get it integrated into my website. I am also going to record a little demo video to make it 
            easier to see how the game works. I am then planning on adding it to my website as well. If time permits I might add one more quick thing to my project but right now I'm pretty comfortable 
            with where I am at.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>None.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>I feel like I did well in pinpointing what was left to bring this project together and managed my time well to achieve each of those goals. </p>
