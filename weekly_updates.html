        <h2>Weekly Update Sep 23 - Sep 29</h2>
        <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
        <p>Last week I continued going through the Unity documentation.  </p>

        <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
        <p>This week I am continuing to go through some tutorials and documentation. I am also working on setting up my development environment 
          including installing Unity Hub and setting up my Unity account. I am hoping to begin importing the packages and assets I will need if time allows.</p>

        <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
        <p>As I am continuing to go through documentation and tutorials, I am finding it very easy to get pulled into different areas that do not apply 
          to my current project, whether it is information outside of the scope of the current project or simply items I will not have time to implement in the current time frame.</p>

        <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
        <p>Over the last couple weeks I have just been familiarizing myself with Unity but I am finding it is taking longer than expect because I of the issue mentioned above. As 
          I try to finish up going through documentation I want to try to make sure I am not going through stuff that is not pertinent to what my project is or going through 
          documentation that I will not have time to implement. </p>
